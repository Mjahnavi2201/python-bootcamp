OOPS:
*real time problems can be solved by oops
*privacy of code
*easy uderstandable
->Object Oriented Programming 
Properties:
->CLASS
->OBJECT
->CONSTRUCTION
->ABSTRACTION
->ENCAPSULATION
->INHERITANCE
->POLYMORPHISM

Class:
-class is a blueprint of an object
-class is a logical entity
-1st letter of class name should be capitalize
-class contains functions,construtors,data

Object:
-object is a real world entity and physical entity
-object is an instance of a class
-instance is a sub part
-object contain properties,behavior,identity

Constructor:
-it is a special method used to invoke instance variable
-construtor doesn't return any value
-while creating the object constructor will called implicitly(default)
-there are three types of construtors
 1.default
 2.parameterized
 3.non-parameterized

Inheritance:
-types of inheritance
 1.single
 2.multiple
 3.multilevel
 4.heirarical
 5.hybrid

Encapsulation:
-binding data and methods into single component is called Encapsulation
-ex: class is the best example of encapsulation
-Advantages:
 1.Code Integretion-security
 2.Acess modifier-public,private,protected

Polymorphism:
-types of polymorphism
 1.Run Time - Method Overriding
 2.Compile Time - Method Overloading
-Human Being:
	in College - Student
	in Theater - Audience
	in Market - Customer
	in Sports - Player
	in Home - Child
